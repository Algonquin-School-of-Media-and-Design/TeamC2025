/*
To Do:
- SphereOverlapActors is expensive, to improve preformance it would be better to know all the enemies targetting the player and use circule math for lack of a better turm, but a component would have to be add to player that would keep track of all enemies targeting in order to properly form the circlue
- Add debug gizmos and set the up to not run only in editor using #if WITH_EDITOR
	- Use a debug bool to turn on and off
	- Use EditCondition/EditConditionHides = "Error Bool" For any debug variables so they only show when needed
